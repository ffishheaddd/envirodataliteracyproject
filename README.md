  Fossil fuel, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can be estimated back to 1751 based on literature that reports on historical energy statistics. In 1991 researchers summarized coal, brown coal, peat, and crude oil production by nation and year dating back to the mid 18th century. Researchers also tabulated solid and liquid fuel trade by nation and year. Pre-1950 production of fuel and fuel trade were calculated. From 1950 to 2014 CO2 emissions were estimated from energy statistics published by the United Nations (2017). This data was compiled into one large data set containing information for Nation, Year, total CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels and cement production, emissions from solid fuel consumption, emissions from liquid fuel consumption, emissions from gas fuel consumption, emissions from cement production, emissions from gas flaring, per capita CO2 emissions (metric tons of carbon) and emissions from bunker fuels (not included in the totals). Below, several methods are used to analyze this data in order to draw some conclusions about the history of CO2 emissions, and where they come from.
